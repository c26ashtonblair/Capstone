## 1. Project Overview

**Name:** `"<PLC_MODEL> PLC Security Assessment"`  
**Short description:** Defensive hardware security research to identify, validate, and remediate confidentiality, integrity, and availability issues in the `<PLC_MODEL>` PLC family.

**Goals**
- Identify design and implementation weaknesses that threaten PLC security.  
- Produce reproducible, defensible experiments for mitigation verification.  
- Deliver actionable remediation guidance to the vendor and site operators.  
- Publish non‑sensitive findings under an agreed disclosure policy.

| **Testing types permitted** | Risk assessment; static firmware review; configuration review; controlled lab testing; fuzzing/emulation (where authorized). |

## 3. Legal, Safety & Ethics

| Topic | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Legal compliance** | Comply with applicable laws and regulations (e.g., ITAR/EAR, GDPR) and facility/industry safety rules (e.g., OSHA, IEC 61508). |
| **Responsible disclosure** | Follow the process in [Section 7](#7-responsible-disclosure-process). |
| **Safety** | Isolate PLCs from live production; use lock‑out/tag‑out; current‑limited supplies (≤ 3 A); test enclosure/Faraday cage as appropriate; adhere to site procedures for control‑system equipment. |
| **Privacy & data handling** | Minimize collection of PII; store redacted logs encrypted (e.g., AES‑256); restrict access to authorized personnel. |

## 4. High‑Level Methodology (Non‑Actionable)

1. **Threat Modeling & Architecture Review**  
   Map PLC architecture, field‑bus interfaces (e.g., Modbus/TCP, EtherNet/IP, PROFINET), HMI, and data flows.

2. **Design & Firmware Review**  
   Static analysis of firmware binaries, startup scripts, and configuration files to identify insecure defaults, weak cryptography, and boot‑integrity gaps.

3. **Behavioral & Functional Testing**  
   Controlled tests of authentication, update mechanisms, safety‑logic behavior, and network behavior; record expected vs. observed results.

4. **Emulation / Sandbox Testing**  
   Reproduce PLC behavior with a simulator/emulator (e.g., vendor emulator, OpenPLC, or a custom sandbox) in an isolated lab.

5. **Side‑Channel & Physical Robustness Assessment**  
   Evaluate protections around debug interfaces (UART/JTAG), power filtering, tamper evidence, and basic fault‑tolerance characteristics.

6. **Mitigation & Verification**  
   Propose hardening measures (e.g., strong auth, signed updates, field‑bus lockdown) and verify them in the lab.

> Raw exploit code or step‑by‑step exploitation instructions are **not** included in this repository and must **never** be published publicly.

## 5. Lab Environment & Reproducibility

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `lab/` | Minimal test harness (scripts, network‑bus mockups, clean firmware images). |
| `configs/` | Sanitized PLC network & safety‑logic configs (no secrets). |
| `simulations/` | Dummy inputs for field‑bus simulators. |
| `logs/` | Redacted logs tied to findings. |
| `reports/` | Machine‑readable JSON/CSV summaries of findings. |

**Key tools that can be part of the harness**

| PLC field‑bus | Recommended emulator / simulator |
|---|---|
| Modbus/TCP | Modbus‑TCP server; custom Python emulation |
| EtherNet/IP | OpENer / vendor emulator |
| PROFINET | Profinet‑Simulator / vendor test harness |
| *(Add/remove protocols as required)* | |

## 6. Sample PLC Vulnerability Report

<details>
<summary><strong>Click to expand</strong></summary>

### Initial Confidential Report

**Title**  
Unsecured Modbus/TCP Gateway on `<PLC_MODEL>` – CVSS 7.3

**Severity**  
**CVSS v3.1 Base Score**: 7.3 (High)

**Discovery Date**  
`2025-10-12`

**Device Details**  
- **Manufacturer**: `<MANUFACTURER>`  
- **Model**: `<PLC_MODEL>`  
- **Serial**: `SN-<XXXXX>`  
- **Field‑bus**: Modbus/TCP (port 502) exposed to the process network

**Impact Statement**  
The Modbus/TCP service is enabled on the PLC’s default configuration and does **not** enforce authentication. An attacker who gains network connectivity can send arbitrary Modbus requests, read/write PLC memory, and potentially bypass safety logic.  
*Business Impact*: Risk of accidental shutdown or unsafe release of controlled material.  
*Technical Impact*: Potential remote code execution (RCE) in the PLC runtime; disclosure of process parameters.

**Evidence (Redacted)**  
- `logs/modbus_scan.txt` – shows successful connection on port 502.  
- `logs/firmware_bin_analysis.txt` – indicates hard‑coded Modbus port and disabled authentication flag.  
- `simulations/modbus_read_example.py` – benign script that reads PLC data via Modbus (no harmful side effects).

**Remediation Recommendations**

| Category | Suggested Fix | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| **Network** | Disable Modbus/TCP if not needed; if required, enable authentication and encryption. | Verify service is inaccessible from non‑authorized VLANs. |
| **Firmware** | Remove hard‑coded Modbus port; enable authentication features. | In emulator, confirm Modbus rejects unauthenticated access. |
| **Configuration** | Enforce signed updates for PLC program/config files. | Lab deploy: unsigned uploads are rejected. |

**Verification Checklist**  
- [ ] Modbus/TCP requires authentication or is disabled.  
- [ ] Firmware update requires a valid signature.  
- [ ] Safety‑logic status flags are protected from unauthorized writes.  
- [ ] Field‑bus interfaces are segmented and monitored.

### Vulnerability Report – `<Device ID>`

**Executive Summary**
- **Asset**: `<PLC_MODEL>`, SN: `<SN>`  
- **Version**: `<Firmware Version>`  
- **Date discovered**: `<YYYY‑MM‑DD>`  
- **Severity**: High (CVSS 7.8)  
- **Risk**: Unauthenticated Modbus/TCP access allows unauthorized commands and data access.

**Detailed Findings**

| Section | Description | Evidence | Remediation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | **Weak default credentials** | Default `admin:admin` active. | Change credentials; enforce password policy. |
| 2.2 | **Unencrypted Modbus/TCP** | Clear‑text payloads observed in lab capture. | Enable encryption/tunneling; restrict to secure VLANs. |
| 2.3 | **Missing boot‑integrity check** | Firmware lacks signed hash check. | Implement signed bootloader and signed firmware. |

**Recommendations**
- Apply a hardened firmware image with signed boot and signed updates.  
- Disable or restrict Modbus/TCP from non‑PLC subnets.  
- Enforce strong passwords and remove defaults.  
- Implement network segmentation and firewall rules for the PLC subnet.

**Mitigation Validation**

| Test | Expected Result | Observed Result | Pass/Fail |
|---|---|---|---|
| Firmware signing | Signed image validated at boot. | `Pass` | `Pass` |
| Modbus/TCP authentication | Default creds fail; auth required. | `Pass` | `Pass` |
| Network segmentation | No Modbus from outside PLC subnet. | `Pass` | `Pass` |

| **Initial notification** | Send a confidential report to the vendor within 48 h of discovery (secure email/portal). |
| **Vendor confirmation** | Await acknowledgement and a ticket/CASE ID. |
| **Patch release** | Collaborate on patch/hardened firmware. |
| **Public release** | After public fix or after 90 days (whichever is sooner), release a sanitized advisory. |
