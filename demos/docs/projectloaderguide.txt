Page 1About This User Guide
This user guide is intended for a customer who has received a CLICK Loader File from an OEM and needs
to write the CLICK project to their CLICK PLC using the CLICK Project Loader tool. Writing the CLICK projectto your PLC is a very simple process and this document will walk you through the required steps.
Note: The file extension of the CLICK Loader File is 'ckl'. This is different from the CLICK Project File, where
the file extension is 'ckp'. The CLICK Project Loader only works with the CLICK Loader Files.
What is CLICK Project Loader?
The CLICK Project Loader is a tool provided with the free CLICK Programming Software (V1.11 or newer).The CLICK Project Loader was developed to provide a simple way for you to write a CLICK Project, providedby an OEM, to your PLC.
When an OEM develops a CLICK Project for you, this Project may be password protected to protect the
confidentiality of processes and information included in the Project. It is also common to have futuremodifications to this project that will be provided to you by the OEM. When these Project updates are providedto the customer only authorized personnel with the password information are able to write the file to the PLC.
With the CLICK Project Loader, an OEM can modify a password-protected CLICK Project and export the
Project as a CLICK Loader File. The OEM can then send the CLICK Loader File to you.
You can use the CLICK Project Loader tool to write the password-protected CLICK Project into your CLICK
PLC. The CLICK Project Loader will verify that the password of the new Project matches the password of theexisting Project in the PLC. The CLICK Project Loader will ONLY write the new Project if the passwordsMATCH.

Page 4Step 2  Configure the PC to PLC Connection: The second step is the setup of the Com Port on the PC. You
need to have a recommended communication cable to connect the PC to the CLICK PLC (Refer topages 1 and 2 for cabling information). 
1 PC: Select the COM Port on the PC that will be used to connect to the CLICK PLC. If you are not sure
which COM Ports are available, click the Detail button. A pop up window will open and display a listof available COM Ports.
2 PLC: Select the COM Port on the CLICK PLC that will be used to connect to the PC. It is recommended to
use Port 1 because the setup of Port 1 is fixed. The CLICK Project Loader uses the setupautomatically as shown below.
When Port1 is selected only the Connection Test button is available. 
•  Connection Test: The Connection Test button can be used to Test if the CLICK Project Loader can
communicate with the CLICK PLC.
When Port2 needs to be used and is selected, the parameters will provide adjustable fields as shown
below. These fields allow you to adjust the COM Port setup to match the setup of Port 2. 
When Port2 is selected, there are three buttons available, which will do the following:
•  Auto Detect: When the communication cable is connected from the PC to the CLICK PLC, use this
button to make the CLICK Project Loader try to find the CLICK PLC automatically.
•  Default Setting: Click on this button to reset all the fields to the default values.
•  Connection Test: The Connection Test button can be used to Test if the CLICK Project Loader can
communicate with the CLICK PLC.CLICK Project Loader User Guide
