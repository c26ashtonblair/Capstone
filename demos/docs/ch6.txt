Chapter 6: TroubleshootingPLC unit Troubleshooting
PLC unit issues are grouped according to their function.  Use the illustration below to find the 
appropriate document page numbers for issues with different PLC unit functions.
T oggle Switch
Switch is in RUN position
When the toggle switch is in the RUN position, the PLC unit should normally be in Run 
mode (indicated by the RUN LED being ON), unless the PLC has been placed in Stop mode 
by a peripheral device through one of the communication ports.  To put the PLC unit in Run 
mode, move the toggle switch to the STOP position and then switch it back again to the RUN 
position.  If the RUN LED then remains off, check the PWR and ERR LED indicators per the 
chart shown below.
Switch is in STOP position
When the toggle switch is in STOP position, the PLC unit should be in Stop mode (indicated 
by the RUN LED being OFF).  Cycle power to the PLC.  If the PLC unit starts up in Run 
mode, with toggle switch in STOP position, it means the PLC unit does not recognize the 
toggle switch position correctly.  Please replace the PLC unit.

Chapter 6: TroubleshootingLED Indicators
The CLICK PLC performs many pre-defined diagnostic routines with every PLC scan, using 
onboard diagnostics that can detect various errors or failures in the PLC.  LEDs on the face of 
the PLC will indicate for specific errors.
The 3 LEDs located next to the RUN/STOP switch power, (PWR, RUN and ERR) indicate 
the status of the PLC unit.  The remainder of the LED indicators are discussed in later sections 
of this chapter:
• TX1/RX1/TX2/RX2/TX3/RX3 & LINK/ACT – Chapter 2
• LED indicators for I/O – Chapter 2LED Status Meaning Necessary action
PWROnThe PLC is powered 
correctly.No action is necessary.
BlinkingThe PLC input power 
is not sufficient.Check the voltage on the terminal located on the bottom of the PLC.  The input voltage should be 
20-28 VDC.  Also check the power input wiring & terminal connections.  The power supply may 
need to be replaced.
OffThere is no power to 
the PLC.Check the voltage on the terminal located on the bottom of the PLC.  The input voltage should be 
20-28 VDC.  Also check the power input wiring & terminal connections.  The power supply may 
need to be replaced.
RUNOnThe PLC is in RUN 
mode.If the toggle switch next to the LED indicators is in RUN position, no action is necessary.  If the 
toggle switch is in STOP position, cycle power the PLC.  If the PLC unit starts up in Run mode, it 
means that the PLC unit does not recognize the toggle switch position correctly, and the PLC 
unit must be replaced.
BlinkingThe PLC is initializing 
the  
C0-04RTD or  
C0-04THM.When a C0-04RTD or C0-04THM is installed in the CLICK PLC system, the RUN LED blinks for up 
to 11 seconds to indicate that the PLC unit is initializing the analog input module after power-up.  
If the RUN LED keeps blinking after the initial 11 seconds, power cycle the CLICK PLC system.  If 
the symptom remains, replace the PLC unit and/or the analog input module.
OffThe PLC is in STOP 
mode.If the toggle switch next to the LED indicators is in STOP position, no action is necessary.  If 
the switch is in RUN position and you want to put the PLC unit in Run mode, toggle the switch 
to STOP position and then back to RUN position.  If the RUN LED stays off, connect the CLICK 
programming software to read the error information.  See the “Error Codes” section at the end 
of this chapter for error message instructions.
ERROn There is an error.Connect the CLICK programming software to check the error.  See the “Error Codes” section at 
the end of this chapter for error message instructions.
Blinking There is a warning.Warnings do not prevent the PLC unit from running.  However, you should check what warnings 
are active.  Connect the CLICK programming software to read the warning information.  See the 
“Error Codes” section at the end of this chapter for error message instructions.
Off There is no error. No action is necessary.
Errors (ERR LED on)  
Errors which may cause the system to function improperly, perhaps causing a safety problem.  The PLC will automatically switch from RUN Mode 
to STOP Mode.  (In STOP Mode all outputs are turned off.) If the PLC is already in STOP Mode when an error is detected, the PLC will not allow a 
transition to RUN Mode until the error has been corrected.   
Examples of errors:
• I/O module error  
• System configuration error  
• Memory check error  
• Project file error
Warnings (ERR LED blinking)  
Warnings that require attention, but do not cause improper operation.  They do not cause or prevent any PLC mode transitions.  The application 
program can use system control bits to detect warnings, and even take the system to an orderly shutdown or switch the PLC to STOP Mode if 
desired.  Examples of warnings:
• Lost SRAM data  
• Battery low voltage
CLICK PLC Hardware User Manual , 6th Edition, Rev. O  – C0-USER-M6–4
Chapter 6: TroubleshootingPower Supply Troubleshooting
When the PWR LED is ON, the CLICK PLC is receiving enough power for operation.  Verify 
the power input voltage at the bottom connector on the PLC unit; the input voltage should 
be 20–28 VDC.
The input voltage measures less than 20VDC
Remove the bottom connector from the CLICK PLC unit and measure the voltage again.  
If the voltage at the connector then measures more than 20VDC, the power supply cannot 
provide enough current for the CLICK PLC.  Replace the power supply with a higher output 
current power supply.  Check the power budget to determine the current required from the 
power supply (see below).
If the voltage still measures less than 20VDC with the connector removed from the PLC, 
and the power supply voltage is not adjustable, then the power supply cannot be used for the 
CLICK PLC.  Replace the power supply with another one.
The input voltage measures greater than 28VDC
If the output current of the power supply is adjustable, decrease the output voltage.  If the 
output voltage cannot be lowered to less than 28VDC, replace the power supply with another 
one.
How to check the power budget
You can use the programming software to check the power budget of the CLICK PLC:
• Connect the PLC to a computer running the CLICK programming software.
• From the software menus, connect the software to the 
PLC by selecting PLC and Connect...
• From the software menus, select Setup and System Configuration...
• The System Configuration Setup window opens, and displays the Power Budget 
in milliamps (mA) required by the PLC system.  The PLC power supply must 
be capable of providing more current than the Power Budget amount.
CLICK PLC Hardware User Manual , 6th Edition, Rev. O  – C0-USER-M6–5
Chapter 6: TroubleshootingI/O Module Troubleshooting
First, check the status of the PWR LED indicators on the I/O modules.  If the PWR LED on 
the PLC unit is on, but there are I/O modules which have PWR LEDs that are off, check the 
connections between the modules.  If the I/O module PWR LEDs remain off, replace those 
modules.
Troubleshooting input modules is slightly different from troubleshooting output modules.  
Please refer to the proper subsection:
• Input module troubleshooting
• Output module troubleshooting
Input Module Troubleshooting
The input modules (including the PLC built-in inputs) can have the following symptoms:
Symptom Necessary Action
Input signal is on, but 
the LED indicator on the 
module is off.Check the external power input voltage on the terminal block.
Check whether the terminal block is attached correctly.
If the input voltage is correct but the LED indicator is still off, replace the input module.
The LED indicator is on, 
but the PLC does not 
work as expected.Check whether the PLC unit RUN LED is ON.  If not, put the PLC in RUN mode.
Check the I/O configuration with the programming software.  (See “How to Check the I/O 
Configuration” on the next page.)
Connect the programming software and check the X bit related to the input point that is on.  
(See “How to Check the I/O Status” later in this section for instructions.)  
If the X bit is off, replace the input module.
CLICK PLC Hardware User Manual , 6th Edition, Rev. O  – C0-USER-M6–6
Chapter 6: TroubleshootingOutput Module Troubleshooting
The output modules (including the PLC built-in outputs) can have the following symptoms:
How to Check the I/O Configuration
You can use the CLICK programming software to check the I/O configuration that the PLC 
is recognizing:
• Connect the PLC to a computer running the CLICK programming software.
• From the software menus, connect the software to the 
PLC by selecting PLC and Connect...
• From the software menus, select Setup and System Configuration...
• The System Configuration Setup window opens, and displays all of the CLICK 
module types the PLC recognizes that are connected in the PLC system.Symptom Necessary Action
The module LED 
indicator is ON, but 
there is no output.Check the external power input voltage on the terminal block.
Check whether the terminal block is attached correctly.
If it is a DC sinking, relay, or AC output, check the voltage between the output and the common.   If 
the output is working correctly, the voltage should be close to zero.
If it is a sourcing output, check the voltage between the output and the 24 VDC input.  
If the output is working correctly, the voltage should be close to zero.
If the LED indicator is ON, but the output voltage is not correct, replace the output module.
The module LED 
indicator is OFF, even 
though the output 
status bit (Y---) is 
supposed to be ON.Check whether the PLC unit RUN LED is ON.  If not, put the PLC in RUN mode.
Check the I/O configuration with the programming software.   
(See “How to Check the I/O Configuration” below.)
Connect the programming software and check whether the Y bit related to the output point is ON.
If the Y bit is not actually ON, use the override feature to manually turn the Y bit ON.   
(See “How to Check the I/O Status” on the next page.)
If the Y bit is ON, but the output is OFF, replace the output module.
The module LED 
indicator is OFF, but the 
output is sending an 
ON signal to the field 
device.Leakage current can be a problem when connecting field devices to I/O modules.  False input 
signals can be generated when the leakage current of the output point is great enough to turn on 
the connected input device.  
To correct this issue, install a resistor in parallel with the input or output of the circuit.  The value 
of this resistor will depend on the amount of leakage current and the voltage applied, but usually a 
10k to 20k ohm resistor will work.  Ensure that the wattage rating of the resistor is correct for your 
application.

Chapter 6: TroubleshootingHow to Check the I/O Status
You can use CLICK programming software Data View window to check the I/O status in the 
PLC unit.
WARNING: Only authorized personnel fully familiar with all aspects of the application should make changes 
to the program.  Make sure that you thoroughly consider the impact of any changes to minimize the risk of 
personal injury or damage to equipment.  Specifically, forcing inputs and outputs to their ON state will cause 
externally connected equipment to operate.
Open or create a data view window by selecting Monitor and Data View from either the menu 
bar, the Navigation window, or the Data View icon.
To add new memory addresses to a Data View window:
• Click on an empty Address field to bring up a small browser button.
• Click the browser button to open the Address Picker window.
• From the Address Picker window, click the Pickup Mode button, select the desired 
I/O or memory location, and then click OK to add that address into the data view.
To troubleshoot I/O from the Data View window:
• Connect to PLC unit
• Force outputs on/off, then check actual outputs to see whether they are actually on or off.
• Edit, Write All New Values, or double click individual output Write icon.
• Externally turn inputs on or off, then check their status in data 
view.  Inputs cannot be forced from Data View.

Chapter 6: TroubleshootingReplacement of I/O modules
WARNING: The CLICK PLC does not have hot swap capability.  Do not disconnect or replace any I/O modules 
without first shutting off power to the PLC PLC unit.
Before replacing an I/O module, please consider the cause of the module problem.  If you 
suspect that another device may have caused the failure in the module, that device may also 
cause the same failure in the replacement module.  As a precaution, you may want to check 
power supplies or other devices connected to the failed module before replacing it.

Chapter 6: TroubleshootingTroubleshooting Electrical Noise Problems
Electrical Noise Problems
Noise is one of the most difficult problems to diagnose.  Electrical noise can enter a system in 
many different ways and can fall into one of two categories, conducted noise or radiated noise.  
It may be difficult to determine how the noise is entering the system, but the corrective actions 
are similar for both types of noise problems.
• Conducted noise is electrical interference introduced into the system 
by way of an attached wire, panel connection, etc.  The interference 
may enter through an I/O circuit, a power supply connection, the 
communication ground connection, or the chassis ground connection.
• Radiated noise is electrical interference introduced into the system without a 
direct electrical connection, much in the same manner as radio waves.
Reducing Electrical Noise
Although electrical noise cannot be completely eliminated, it can be reduced to a level that will 
not adversely affect the system.
• Most noise problems result from improper grounding of the system.  A good 
earth ground can be the single most effective way to correct noise problems.  If 
a ground is not available, install a ground rod as close to the system as possible.  
Ensure that all ground wires are single point grounds, and are not daisy chained 
from one device to another.  Ground other metal enclosures near the system.  A 
loose wire can act as a large antenna, introducing noise into the system; so, 
tighten all connections in your system.  Loose ground wires are more susceptible 
to noise than the other wires in your system.  Review Chapter 3: Installation 
and Wiring , if you have questions regarding how to ground your system.
• Electrical noise can enter the system through the power source for the PLC and 
I/O circuits.  Installing an isolation transformer for all AC sources can correct this 
problem.  DC sources should be well-grounded, good quality power supplies.
• Separate input wiring from output wiring.  Never run low-
voltage I/O wiring close to high voltage wiring.

Chapter 6: TroubleshootingError Codes
When there is an Error or Warning, the error code is stored in the System Data register SD1.
When an Error occurs during the operation, the CLICK PLC system goes to the STOP mode 
immediately and the ERR LED on the PLC unit turns on.  On the other hand, when a 
Warning occurs during the operation, the CLICK PLC system stays in RUN mode and the 
ERR LED on the PLC unit starts blinking.  
In the error code tables that follow, the Category column indicates whether the error code is 
an Error or a Warning.  If any of the Warnings listed is critical for your control system, add an 
additional ladder program to put the CLICK PLC system in STOP mode when that specific 
Warning occurs.  Here is an example.
