Step 1: Gain Initial access into target network
Action: Assume we have initial access via RDP
Step 2: Gain further permissions with in network/system
Action: Steal or falsify Valid user credentials assume this is already completed
Step 3: Establish persistence
Action: Assume we have this done after initial
Step 4: Map the network
Action: go through and identify the to two laptops connected by ethernet that are connected to the PLC
Step 5: Identify target OT systems
Action: On this network the targets we have discovered programming computer which is connected to a PLC
Step 5: Create a plan of attack based off the targets identified
Action: Take control of HMI and change it without the User knowing, change the program on the programming computer, or hack the mod bus and flip bits
Step 6: Execute Attacks i.e. shutdowns, data collections, modify systems
Action: attempt to execute the HMI attack by modifying the system so that when the switch is on it rapidly turns the output light on and off till it breaks
